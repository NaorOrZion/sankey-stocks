# Sankey Stocks

Author: Naor Or-Zion

## What is the _Sankey Stocks_ program?

Welcome to the Sankey-Stocks program!
This tool has been crafted to enable users of all ages, even 10-year-old enthusiasts, to effortlessly visualize income statements. The annual data is sourced from "https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/" so make sure to sign up on the website to obtain your API key.

You can input the API key directly into the designated variable (named "API_KEY", found in sankey-stocks.py file) after reviewing the instructions, or opt for a more secure approach by retrieving it through an environment variable.

Explore the API documentation at "https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/" for a comprehensive understanding. Additionally, delve into Plotly's chart documentation at "https://plotly.com/python/sankey-diagram/" to unlock the full potential of dynamic visualizations.

**Before**: An ugly income statement that is hard to read.

**Please notice**
- An optimal sankey chart will be created only when the company is profitable (Net income greater than 0$).
- A chart will be displayed in html page with unordered dynamic nodes that you can drag & drop as you wish.
- Not all companies have a good chart, that's because some of them post their data differently.
- When you are asked to write a ticker, please remember that a ticker is the "name" of the stock and not the name of the company.
